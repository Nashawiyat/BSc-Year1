Java coding projects I worked on in my 1st year of bachelor's degree at Heriot-Watt University Malaysia (2023-2024).
These do not include the smaller coding projects used to practice coding and Data Structures and Algorithms.
- f28pa-assignment is a project I worked on alone to practice basic coding and OOP concepts, as well as I/O. It consists
  of 2 questions, with each question being a separate program. Question1 being an Athele Analysis software, and Question2 being a theatre booking software.
- f28pb-assignment is a project I worked on alone to practice OOP, Data Structures and J-Unit testing. It is a software that reads and analysies text files
  and gives feedback on them depending on the commands give (provided from a text-file).
- Wordle is a project I worked on alone to practice different coding concepts and attempting to make a comparison algoirthm using Data Structures to
  achieve a lower worst-case and average time-complexity. It is a basic Wordle game software that plays on the console.
