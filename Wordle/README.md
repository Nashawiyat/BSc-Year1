Wordle is a Java project I worked on alone to practice different coding concepts and attempting to make a comparison algoirthm using Data Structures
to achieve a lower worst-case and average time-complexity. It is a basic Wordle game software that plays on the console. 
Unlike my previous projects, Wordle was made on VS-Code, while the others were made in Eclipse.
