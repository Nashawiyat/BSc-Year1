f28pa-assignment is a Java project I worked on alone as a part of a university assignment to practice basic coding and OOP concepts, as well
as I/O. It consists of 2 questions, with each question being a separate program. Question1 being an Athele Analysis software, and Question2
being a theatre booking software.
